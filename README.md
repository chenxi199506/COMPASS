# 🧠 Building Reliable Evidence with AI: An Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework and Methodological Audit of 1.2 Million Randomized Controlled Trials

### *An Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework and Methodological Audit of 1.2 Million Randomized Controlled Trials for Building Reliable Evidence in Biomedical Research*


### 🔍 Overview
This project addresses the critical challenges of **accelerating RCT volume** and the **hallucination problem in Large Language Models (LLMs)** by introducing a novel, multi-agent AI framework for high-fidelity evidence synthesis.

It introduces three major components:

- **ACCORD (Agent for Calibrated Consensus On Reported Data from literature)** – An orchestrated multi-agent framework that automates literature extraction through **task planning, weighted ensemble voting, and result evaluation**, achieving system-level performance exceeding individual models.
- **Structured RCT Database** – A comprehensive repository of **490,430 high-quality Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** derived from processing **1,209,547 publications**, supporting large-scale methodological audit.
- **COMPASS** – The **Comprehensive Online Meta-Analysis Platform for Smart Synthesis**, integrating multi-agent literature extraction with large-scale methodological analysis.

## 🧩 System Workflow

The core of our system is the **ACCORD Multi-Agent Framework**, designed to overcome individual LLM limitations. The workflow mimics rigorous academic review through a four-stage process:

1.  **Task Planning:** Deconstructing complex extraction tasks.
2.  **Targeted Task Distribution:** Assigning tasks to specialized agents.
3.  **Weighted Voting:** Aggregating and cross-verifying agent outputs.
4.  **Expert Evaluation:** Final quality control and data calibration.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Statistical Power:** Only **60.4%** of analyzed RCTs were found to be **adequately powered**, though this proportion is trending upwards.
- **P-Hacking:** The prevalence of P-hacking exhibits a **U-shaped distribution**, being most prevalent in **mid-tier journals** and among papers that are either highly cited or uncited.
- **Model Performance:** The ACCORD framework significantly reduced hallucinations and achieved higher extraction accuracy than any single LLM.

## 💡 Conclusion
We developed **COMPASS**, the first online platform to integrate multi-agent literature extraction with large-scale methodological analysis.
Our work demonstrates that **intelligent system integration (ACCORD)** and continuous methodological monitoring are essential for deploying reliable AI in biomedical research, moving beyond the pursuit of raw model power to robust, orchestrated systems.
